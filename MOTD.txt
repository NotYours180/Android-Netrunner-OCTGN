=====Message of the Day======

Emergency Fix Deployed! Game scripts should function once more.

Sorry for the break people, I got caught by surprise by this as much as all of you.

Ignore the complaining message at the start about the old API. Emergency measure until I can upgrade without breaking shit.

Please restart your OCTGN client if you instead saw a message about "Script Version not specified"
